Plotly Dash Bootstrap Project
I am new to plotly-dash and I am trying to design the dashboard with graphs.
My dash app is connected to "OWID - Our Word In Data" website to get data related to the Coronavirus Pandemic, and use this data as a basis for presenting statistical information on Dashboard.
The data has been handling before creating data and drawing graphs, so I am not sure that it will be accurate with the epidemic situation in reality.
The purpose of this dashboard just is to try to apply what I have learned about Plotly Dash to create a website.
